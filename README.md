# Purpose

This repo contains notes and projects from Stephen's TypeScript course that
I am taking.

## Goals

I am want to be able to convert an existing Create-React-App project into
a Next.js + TypeScript project. From this, I also hope to be able to develop
a self-documenting front-end and back-end application for my projects
very easily by leveraging the benefits of TypeScript.
